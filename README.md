# GVG Brain Dump Repository

A place to dump anything I am working on or thinking about.

## About This Repository

I wanted to start a repository that I can push to when I have some time. It is a collection of things I have worked on or plan to work on. I have a small brain so it is nice to write things down in a centralized location so I can forget.

## Repository Structure

```
gvg-notes/
├── Projects/           # Project-specific documentation and guides
